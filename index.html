                            Whether it is a hot summer day or the holiday season, ice cream and gelato are  
                            well-loved frozen desserts enjoyed by people of any age (although some consider  
                            gelato to be the "grown-up" version of ice cream). The two look and taste similar,  
                            but are they actually the same? Taking into account gelato is the Italian word for  
                            ice cream, you would think so, but there are actually a few differences between 
                            the two.

                        <h1>The ingredients</h1>

                        <p>
                            Two of the main ingredients in both ice cream and gelato are milk and cream, 
                            but it is the amount of each that results in differing desserts. As the name 
                            implies, "ice cream" contains more cream than milk, whereas gelato is made 
                            with a greater proportion of whole milk to cream. Another ingredient that 
                            distinguishes the two is eggs; ice cream includes egg yolks while gelato is 
                            (most often) completely void of eggs.
                        </p>

                        <h1>The process</h1>

                        <p>
                            It is not just the ingredients that separate the two, it is also the way that each 
                            is made.  Ice cream and gelato must be churned to create that creamy, 
                            scoopable goodness, but it is the speed at which they are churned—and the 
                            resulting amount of air incorporated—that is different.  Gelato is churned at a 
                            slower speed than ice cream, which creates a denser consistency since less air 
                            is whipped into the mixture. Gelato contains about 25 to 30 percent air, while 
                            ice cream can contain as much as 50 percent air.
